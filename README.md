# ResTrain – Learn the colour coding on resistors

Since I encountered resistors the first time as a teenager, I struggled with the colour coding scheme that describes how many Ohms a resistor has.

On a cloudy Friday afternoon, I decided to finally get rid of this item on my bucket list and write a small web-app that helps you with learning it (since I couldn't find anything else online that pleased me).

This is the result.

As with all my projects, feel free to comment and critizise. I'm especially keen on suggestions for better grey/silver and yellow/gold gradients in the `.../public/b/res.svg` vector graphic, since I'm not artist enough to put more time in it.

You can find a live version at [restrain.serena-mueller.ch](http://restrain.serena-mueller.ch).

The only thing left for me is to learn the colour codes … o:)
